# Saturn Templates

> ... *For my selfish self* ...

These are some saturn templates I like to have handy every time I want to experiment with an ASP.NET application
Please keep in mind that these template are organized around my way of thinking, feel free to point out at what can be improved and remember that this is just *a way* not *the way* to do things in Saturn/F#

For more complete things, please use the [SAFE] templates or the official [Saturn] templates.
